###Taeyoon Choi : [Concept and Theory Studio](https://github.com/tchoi8/ConceptsClass)
   

Taeyoon's class: 9.25, 10.9, 10.23, 11.6, 11.20  
This class focus on building conceptual tools for artists. Through writing, discussion, documentation, presentation and site visits, students will learn about the practical skills for developing concepts.

We will ask and discuss questions such as 

Why do we make art?
Why do we use technology to make art?
What is poetic about computation? 
What is the art history that's relevant to my art?
What is critical theory and why is it important?
Where is my audience and my community?

###Zach Lieberman : Recreating the past



Zach's class: 9.15~18 (17,18 Salon), 10.1, 10.8, 10.22, 11~(tbd) 



Each week, we take a look at a different famous media artwork that have been made in code and recreate them from scratch, discussing the algorithmic approaches and tools, as well as poetic underpinnings.  By recreating these works, we can investigate also what modern tools and approaches have to offer.  We will also look at broader examples about what the artwork teaches us about code and algorithmic approaches.  For example, seminal works like Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv's "Text Rain" can be used as a starting point for discussing computer vision based interaction.  The class takes inspiration from the re:code project which aims to recode older media artworks, and participants will be invited through homework assignments to contribute.   

### Final showcase



Showcase week 11.16~22 : Open studio, talks, workshops, organized by Lauren Gardner.  

Final week 11.23~11.25 : Documentation, feedback, dinner.
